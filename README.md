Three-Body Star System Simulation

This Processing sketch simulates a three-body star system where a planet is trapped in the gravitational pull of three stars. The stars and the planet interact with each other based on gravitational forces, creating dynamic movements within the system.

Features

⦁	Three Celestial Bodies: The simulation includes three movable celestial bodies representing stars and one planet.

⦁	Gravitational Interaction: Each celestial body attracts others based on gravitational force, causing them to move dynamically.

⦁	Visual Representation: The stars and the planet are visually represented as colored circles, with the planet distinguished from the stars.

⦁	Starry Background: The background features a starry sky, enhancing the celestial atmosphere of the simulation.

How to Use

⦁	Download the files and open the Processing sketch in the Processing IDE.

⦁	Run the sketch to start the simulation.

⦁	Observe the movements of the celestial bodies as they interact with each other gravitationally.

⦁	Experiment with different initial parameters, such as the mass and velocity of the celestial bodies, to observe how they affect the system dynamics.

Requirements

⦁	Processing: Ensure you have Processing installed on your system to run the sketch.

⦁	Java Runtime Environment: Processing requires Java to run sketches.
